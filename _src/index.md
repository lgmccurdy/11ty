# Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

A classic, soft, and chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe that everyone will love!

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt (if using). Set aside.

3. **Cream the butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla**: Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. **Combine with dry ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined.

6. **Add the chocolate chips**: Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

7. **Scoop the dough**: Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake**: Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden and the centers are soft.

9. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips

- For extra chewy cookies, you can chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking.
- You can substitute half the chocolate chips with chopped nuts for added crunch.
- If you like your cookies crispy, bake them for an extra 1-2 minutes.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!
